#
#  Contains two functions, biased_rolls(prob_list, s, n) and draw_histogram(m, rolls, width).
#  
#  biased_rolls(prob_list, s, n) has input arguements prob_list which is an array containing the probabilities
#  of each side, s which is the seed value to be used to initialize the PRNG prior to calling random()
#  and n is the number of time the dice must be rolled.
#  The function returns the array rolls which contains the side of the die after each roll in the order
#  that they occured.
#
#  draw_histogram(m, rolls, width) has input arguements m which is the number of sides on the die,
#  rolls is the array containg the result of each roll in the order that the occured,  
#  width is the number of hastags to be assigned to the most common occurence or most common side.
