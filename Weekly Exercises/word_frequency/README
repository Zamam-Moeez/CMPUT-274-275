#   Weekly Exercise 3: Word Frequency
#-------------------------------------------- 
# Included Files:
#     * freq.py         
#     * README
#
# Program definition:
#
#  Contains three functions, openreadsort(), occurence() and printwrite().
#  
#  openreadsort() reads text file entered as terminal argument, splits into a sorted list of words called words
#  returns the list 'words'
#
#  occurence() calls openreadsort() and computes the number of occurences of each word from list words and stores these values as a dictionary 'occurs'
#  and stores these values as a dictionary 'occurs',returns 'occurs'
#
#  printwrite() calls occurence(), creates list containing frequency of each word and writes result in desired format to output text file, file.out
#
# Running instructions:
# 
#  call printwrite() from under if __name__ == "__main__" and then call program freq.py with arguement text file from terminal
#
