# Exercise 1: Password Validate
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Included Files:
#     * passwordvalidate.py         
#     * README
#
# Program definition:
#
#  Contains two functions, validate() and generate().
#  
#  validate() validates the security of a password taken as argument
#  and returns the result as either "Secure", "Insecure" or "Invalid" based on certain parameters.
#  
#  generate() psuedo-randomnly generates a password of input argument n and returns password of length n that is
#  considered "Secure" by parameters laid out in validate() function.
#
# Running instructions:
# 
#  type print(validate(input_password)) under if __name__ == "__main__": where input_password is 
#  any string password to verify validity.
#    
#  type print(generate(n)) under if __name__ == "__main__": where n is the desired length 
#  of the secure password.
