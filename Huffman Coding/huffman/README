Running Instructons:

A file within the same folder as util.py can be run using command python3 compress.py somefile

Similary a file with .huf extension can be decompressed by running python3 decompress.py somefile.huf

This can also be done using pipline

Web Server:

Move a file to the wwwwroot folder.

Open terminal in wwwwroot folder and run python3 ../webserver.py, this initialises the localhost.

To check open https://localhost:8000/ is the web browser, a picture of David Huffman and a black oval should be seen.

Run python3 ,,//compress.py somefile where somefile is the file being compressed.

This will result in a compressed .huf file being created in wwwroot named somefile.huf.

To check open localhost:8000/somefile in browser and download the file.

Run cmp on the original file and the one from the local host to see if differences exist.

Assumptions/Notes:

It is assumed that somefile exists when running compress.py or decompress.py
