Exercise 3 Part 2: Reference Manager

Included Files:
    * we3_test.cpp
    * ref_manager.cpp         
    * README
    * Makefile

Program definition:

we3_test.cpp takes certain queries, calls functions in ref_manager.cpp to handle those queries.
ref_manager.cpp allocates and dealocates memory for strings.
pointers[] is an an array of 100 pointers to strings
garbage[] is an array of 100 pointers no longer referenced by pointers[]

readString() takes two arguements, length and ptrIndex.
It reads in string of length and reassigns pointer in pointers array at ptrIndex to the string

reassignPointer() takes two arguements, ptrIndex and newAddr. It reassigns pointer in pointers array at ptrIndex
to newAddr. It changes the reference count in unordered map refCount for string previously pointed to and the newly referenced string

garbageCollect() goes through the garbage array, printing each string in the garbage array then freeing up memory

destructor() goes throught pointers array, calls reassignPointer and reassigns each pointer to NULL then frees up memory
by calling garbage collect

Running Instructions:

Run included Makefile along with suppoted queries
